    <p>This recipe was created many moons ago while I was cooking in the studio. The homies had no idea what was coming when I hit them with this tasty masterpiece.</p>

        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil  </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons capers </li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 slices lemon</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a large heavy skillet over medium heat for 3 minutes.</li>
